                        <p> I am currently a sophomore double major in
                             Computer Science and Mathematics at Whitman College. I have 
                             experience in Machine Learning and Web Development, and I am interested in Problem Solving.
                              I have worked on web-development and machine learning project: personal and team projects.
                              I am very passionate about research in computer science, and I aspire to be a 
                              software developer and an app creator.  </p>
